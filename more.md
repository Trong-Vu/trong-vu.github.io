title: More about me
layout: page
---

I was born and raised in Belgium from first generation immigrants parents coming from Vietnam.
Growing up in-between 2 cultures

I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my current job, this passion led me to challenge me and my colleagues to find durable and efficient solution to our problems. I often get out of the scope of what I am in charge of to help my colleagues.

Outside of work, I spend my time rock-climbing.
This is a sport that requires perception, self-awareness and precision.
Every new route is a new problem to solve, which matches perfectly with my focused and disciplined character.
